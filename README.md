### Goal and Value of the Application
Genshin Impact is a very popular game with over 60 million players and a plethora of awards. One of the main reasons players like me are so invested into the game is because of the amazing characters, which are obtainable through a rotating gacha system...

The reason why one can add multiple copies of a character to the wishlist is because duplicates in the game give massive upgrades to the character.
