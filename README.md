### Quick Notes
As of now, the site is not ready to be used on mobile devices.

### Goal and Value of the Application
Genshin Impact is a very popular game with over 60 million players and a plethora of awards. One of the main reasons players like me are so invested into the game is because of the amazing characters, which are obtainable through a rotating gacha system. Therefore, the goal of my web application is to be a tool for players to keep track of which characters they would like to try to obtain in the future. I think that this can be valuable because it is a visual list where information about each character can be included, and I have not found any sites like this before. Moreover, I used an API that the community made to extract game data, so I believe my website would easily be updated with every new character release. The reason why one can add multiple copies of a character to the wishlist is because duplicates in the game give massive upgrades to the character.

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
